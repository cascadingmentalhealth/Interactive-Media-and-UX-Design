            <h1> Lesson Delivery - on campus </h1>
            <p> Our 'on-campus' lessons provide students with an interactive, face-to-face learning experience. However, we understand that students may not always be able to attend in-person which is why our on-campus lessons are also live-streamed so that our students are able to learn from home. The lessons are also recorded for students to look back and review on. </p>
            <h1> Lesson Delivery - online </h1>
            <p> Some students prefer to learn at home, this is why Uplift Education offers dedicated live online lessons that are equally interactive as our face-to-face lessons. You can access our lessons from anywhere knowing that you will be fully supported in your learning. </p>
